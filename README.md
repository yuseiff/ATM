# ATM

A simulator for an ATM machine written in C++ would be a program that mimics the functionality of a real-world ATM machine. The program would allow users to interact 
with the simulated ATM through a user interface, such as a command line interface or a graphical user interface. The program would be able to handle various ATM 
transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and account balance inquiries. Additionally, the program could include features such as security measures, such as password protection, 
to ensure the privacy and security of user information.

the project is just a simple simulator without database
and just a  one const pin.
